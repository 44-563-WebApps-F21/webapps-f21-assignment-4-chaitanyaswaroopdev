        <p style="font-size: large;">Arthur, do you
            think that what I did nearly eighteen years ago should be brought up
            against me now? Do you think it fair that a man’s whole career should be
            ruined for a fault done in one’s boyhood almost? I was twenty-two at the
            time, and I had the double misfortune of being well-born and poor, two
            unforgiveable things nowadays. Is it fair that the folly, the sin of
            one’s youth, if men choose to call it a sin, should wreck a life like
            mine, should place me in the pillory, should shatter all that I have
            worked for, all that I have built up. Is it fair, Arthur?</p>
